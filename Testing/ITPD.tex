\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose}

\textit{[New purpose]}

\subsection{Scope}

\pe is a digital management system for car sharing that exclusively employs electric cars to provide its service. The system provides all the functionalities normally provided by a car sharing service: registering to the service, find the location of nearby available cars, reserve cars up to a short amount of time, unlock the chosen car once found, ride it and then park it in a safe area, when it will be automatically locked and the fee paid.

In addition, the system gives bonuses and penalities in term of discounts or overprices depending on the behavior of the user, in order to promote virtuous behaviors.

\pe is therefore a inherently distributed system, based on a central server interactions with many distributed nodes. All these components will be examined in more detail in the subsequent sections of the document.

\section{Integration Strategy}

We believe that the integration of different components should not be a completely different phase from the development of each component.

Integration should happen as soon as possible even with mock implementation of the components. Such early integration helps in identifying possible inconsistencies in the design documents: the sooner those inconsistencies are discovered, the simpler it is to fix them.

\subsection{Entry criteria}

As long as the integration tests are automatic and fast, we do not advocate for any strong or specific precondition.

On the other side we advocate to run the integration test after each commit. This procedure helps in catching regressions as early as possible.

Unit tests should be used in order to guarantee the interface exposed and documented are respected, and that the component runs in isolation, fulfilling its assigned functionalities.

\subsection{Elements to be integrated}

All the components that interact with the user must be integrated with the User FrontEnd. Similarly all the components that need to interact with the Staff need to be integrated with the Staff FrontEnd.

Also, the GEOLOCATION component needs to be integrated with the Car GUI.

Concerning external services, only a few components need to interact with them. In particular we need to integrate the BILLING\_SYSTEM, POSITION, GEOLOCATION, USER\_MANAGER with external services.

Finally, only a few services must be integrated between each other in the system, thanks to the high degree of decoupling reached during the design phase.

The services that must be integrated inside the system are the following:

\begin{description}

\item[IT01] \hfill
\toBeIntegrated
	{GEOLOCATION}
	{POSITION}
	{GEOLOCATION/AvailableCar}
	{The position of each car, retrieved using POSITION/Car, is used in order to describe which cars are close to a specific position.}

\item[IT02] \hfill
\toBeIntegratedThree
	{GEOLOCATION}
	{POSITION}
	{CAR\_MANAGER}
	{GEOLOCATION/Issues}
	{The position of each car, retrieved using POSITION/Car, that has some issues (detectable using CAR/Telemetry) is used to communicate to the staff where are cars that need their intervent.}

\item[IT03] \hfill
\toBeIntegrated
	{RIDE\_MANAGER}
	{CAR\_MANAGER}

	{When a ride starts, detected using CAR/Telemetry, the RIDE/Start method is invoked.}

\toBeIntegrated
	{RIDE\_MANAGER}
	{CAR\_MANAGER}
	{RIDE/End}
	{When a ride stops, detected using CAR/Telemetry, the RIDE/End method is invoked.}

\item[IT05] \hfill
\toBeIntegrated
	{BILLING\_MANAGER}
	{RIDE\_MANAGER}
	{BILL/Pay}
	{At the end of a ride, detected because the procedure RIDE/End has been called, the payment procedure of the user starts.}

\item[IT06] \hfill
\toBeIntegrated
	{BILLING\_MANAGER}
	{BOOKING\_MANAGER}
	{BILL/CalculateExpireBookFee}
	{When a booking expires, detected using BOOKING/Expire, the user should be asked to pay the fee calculated using BILL/CalculateExpireBookFee}
	
\item[IT07] \hfill
\toBeIntegratedFour
	{BILLING\_MANAGER}
	{RIDE\_MANAGER}
	{POSITION}
	{GEOLOCATION}
	{BILL/CalculateUnsafeParkingFine}
	{When the user ends a ride, detected using RIDE/End, and the car is unsafely parked, detected using POSITION/Car and GEOLOCATION/IsSafeArea, the user is prompted to pay for the ride plus the fee for having parked the car in an unsafe position.}
	
\item[IT08] \hfill
\toBeIntegrated
	{BILLING\_MANAGER}
	{CAR\_MANAGER}
	{BILL/CalculateRideFee}
	{After a ride is concluded, the amount of the fee the user is prompted to pay is determinated on the base of several bonuses that may be applied. To determinate which bonuses apply, CAR/Telemetry is used.}

\end{description}

\subsection{Integration testing strategy}

We chosed, basically, to implement a bottom-up approach to our integration testing strategy. 

Actually, the only components that requires a sub-components integration are the three services that are physically distributed. Once integrate, we can proceed to a higher-level integration reasoning about them in terms of a simpler logical component.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item CAR\_MANAGER: this component needs its own integration. It is distributed between the car system and the main server; it is also the only components that touches the hardware side of the project. In our opinion it should be the first component to be integrated.
	\item ISSUE\_MANAGER: another component that needs its own integration. However its functionality is more bounded that the one provided by CAR\_MANAGER.
	\item POSITION: this component needs it own integration too. However, its functionality is pretty standard and well known.
\end{enumerate}

In parallel we can proced to integrate the external services with our own high-level components, namely BILLING\_SYSTEM , POSITION , GEOLOCATION,  and  USER\_MANAGER.

\subsection{Sequence of components integration}

Our design tried to keep the components very decoupled. This gives us a lot of flexibility in the integration process.

There are not hard constraints in what component should be integrated first, as long as sub-components get integrated into higher-level components before proceeding with the integration of high-level ones.

Of course all the components needs to be integrated with the user interface. We are not showing all those integrations, that are extremely simple but necessary. Since the NOTIFIER components is part of the user interface, we are not showing the integrations that concern this component.

Before going deeply inside the description of the high-level integrations, we describe the sub-component integrations required.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{UML/IntegrationDistributedComponents.png}
	\caption{Sub-components integration regarding physically splitted components into a single, high-level logical component.}
\end{figure}	

In the following diagram we show what components integrates with others.

There are not strict dependencies: it is more a net that a pyramid.

\section{Individual Steps and Tests Description}

In this section we describe what test are necessary for each integration.

For each integration we list and describe the most important tests.

\begin{description}
	\begin{test}
		\testCase{An available car is located at coordinates A}
			{Each invocation of GEOLOCATION/AvailableCar that includes the coordinates A shows the car.}
		\testCase{No available car is located inside a circle of radius R centered in the point C}
			{Each invocation of GEOLOCATION/AvailableCar that is centered in the point C with radius less or equal than R returns an empty set.}
	\end{test}

	\begin{test}
		\testCase{A car with issues determinated using the onboard system is located on point A}
			{Each invocation of GEOLOCATION/Issue that includes the point A shows the car.}
		\testCase{No car with any kind of issue is inside a circle of radius R centered in point C}
			{Each invocation of GEOLOCATION/Issue that is centered in point C with radius less or equal than R returns an empty set.}
	\end{test}

	\begin{test}
		\testCase{CAR/Telemetry notifies that a ride began}
			{The method RIDE/Start is invoked and succeedes.}
	\end{test}

	\begin{test}
		\testCase{CAR/Telemetry notifies that a ride finished}
			{The method RIDE/End is invoked and succeedes.}
	\end{test}

	\begin{test}
		\testCase{The method RIDE/End is invoked}
			{The method BILL/Pay is invoked and it starts the payment proccedure of the user.}
	\end{test}

	\begin{test}
		\testCase{The method BOOKING/Expire is invoked}
			{The method BILL/CalculateExpireBookFee is invoked and it is used to provide the fine for the user.}
	\end{test}

	\begin{test}
		\testCase{The method RIDE/End is invoked, the car position (determinate using POSITION/Car) is not inside a safe area (determinate using GEOLOCATION/IsSafeArea)}
			{The method BILL/CalculateUnsafeParkingFine is invoked and it is used to provide the fine for the user.}
	\end{test}

	\begin{test}
		\testCase{The method RIDE/End is invoked, the car is safely parked}
			{The method BILL/CalculateRideFee is invoked and the method uses all the necessary informations from the CAR\_MANAGER to apply all the bonuses or the maluses to the ride.}
	\end{test}
\end{description}

This test are to be considered as guidelines. We described only the most straightforward test that must be implemented; however, other test can be deployed too.

Usually it is a good idea to test not only that a method is invoked and used, but also that a method is not invoked. We do not specifically describe those tests because they are extremely implementation dependent. While in some cases that kind of test is extremely important, in other cases is quite useless. 

It is up to the developing team to understand if it is the case to implement these additional tests.


\newpage
\section{Tools and Test Equipment Required}

Any tools or framework works just as well in this project: our suggestion is to use a well know libraries and framework.

A very reasonable choice is \textbf{JUnit4}, which is the default testing framework for Java application.

\subsection{Continuos Integration and Unit Testing}

A server of continuos integration is necessary in order to execute the integration tests and the unit tests after each commit to the main code base.

Each developer should still be able to run every test in its developing machine.

The unit test suite is expected to be extremelly fast so that it can be executed at will by every developer without slowing down their workflow.

For the integration test, we don't require them to be fast, although is still a very desiderable property. But they should be, at very least, completely automatic.

\subsection{Testing Strategy}

We do not advocate for rigid methodology. Test should be produced in order to avoid regression. 

After fixing a bug, a test relative to that same bug should be put in place and should be continuosly run.

\subsection{Deploying}

The deploy of the whole architecture should require the least amount of stesp possible, ideally just one.

If the application is serving live traffic, a deploy of a new version should be done following the incremental GREEN / BLUE methodology: start running the new software only a small fraction of the overall traffic to the new version and, if everything on the control metrics still looks fine, increase the amount of traffic redirected to the new version untill you don't reach the totality. Immediately roll back to the previous version at the first sign of problems.

\newpage
\section{Program Stubs and Test Data Required}

\subsection{Stubs}

At this time, no stubs are strictly required to run our integration test suite.

Concerning the integration of our system with external services, we noticed that most interactions can be covered with the unit tests of single components: even in these cases, stubs are not required as all our external services expose some specific testing APIs that can be used for this purpose.

\subsection{Test Data}

The necessary test data will be generated using ad-hoc software.

There should be two different databases: one for tests and another for production. If it is necessary to simulate the load of the production database, we will not directly use it, but we populate the test database.

\subsection{Hardware Emulation}

Running integration tests using a real car may be difficult. That's why an emulation environment for the car's onboard system should be enough to run all our integration tests: this solution maked running tests faster and easier. 

Also, the developing time of the hardware is usualy longer than the developing time of software, and relying on the actual hardware for running integration test may lead to delays or to skip the run of fundamental integration tests, a situation we would prefer to avoid.
